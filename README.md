### Overview
This project focuses on advancing robotic vision for densely fruited crops under challenging real-world conditions. It introduces:
- A large-scale data repository of three distinct datasets.
- A novel synthetic data generation algorithm.
- An optimized detection model for dense crop analysis.

### Key Contributions
1. **Comprehensive Datasets**:
   - Benchmark dataset for supervised learning.
   - Semi-annotated dataset for weakly and semi-supervised learning.
   - Synthetic dataset for unsupervised learning and domain adaptation.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**:
   - Scalable and cost-effective for dense crop annotations.
   - Facilitates research in domain adaptation and unsupervised learning.

3. **Efficient Detection Model**:
   - Achieved **75.06% SEN**, **56.85% IoU**, and **72.49% DICE**.
   - Relative gains: **24.71%**, **13.5%**, and **8.6%** above baseline.
